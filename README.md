# About this project

This project is a simulation of a mobile bank app, I used it to learn the basics of Flutter development, such as widget and state management, modularization, screen navigation, animations and as a extra I added Firebase authentication

Authentication screen

This screen is fully functional, allowing users to create their accounts and authenticate(duh) via Firebase, it also has some alerts indicating that something has gone south or that the user authenticated successfully!

Main Screen

Here the user is able to see his balance, and navigate between this screen and the profile screen, although it's mostly non-functional, this screen has a cool little start up animation!

Profile Screen

Here the user is able to check and modify his profile and also add his own profile picture, so that they can, you know, stare at their beatiful face.

And that's it, it was really fun to dedicate some time in learning Flutter and realising the weaknesses and strengths of this framework, all-in-all it's really solid to work with and I hope I can do more useful projects with it later.
